# Web Page Design - Spring 2018
## Lab 0 - You need to Git

**Purpose:** This purpose of this lab is to gain some passing familiarity with our coursework submission system. You have a few options for how to complete and submit your work. There are two suggested options and both will be demonstrated in class.

## Option 1: Windows Client and Local Text Editor

This is the easiest to set up, but the least portable and least flexible.

## Option 2: CodeAnywhere

This is the hardest to set up, but once it is, everything is wonderful.



**Assumptions:** This assignment assumes that you have already set up a Codeanywhere account and a GitHub account and linked them together.

**Part 1 - Cloning the Repository:** Clone this repository into a new workspace in your [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) account. Once you are in your workspace, continue on to the next part.

**Part 2 - Instructions:** Create a basic HTML file called `index.html`. It should be an informative page about an animal of your choice (real or fictional). If you already know a few HTMl tags, feel free to use them, but don't sweat it if you don't. This is more about learning git than HTML.

Once you are finished, if you are in your CodeAnywhere workspace, you can push your changes to the repository by entering the following commands into the SSH terminal (these three commands should be committed to memory):

`````
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "Some commit message."
    $ git push -u origin master
`````

If you have trouble with these commands, ask the instructor or refer to the provided course resources.
