# Web Page Design - Spring 2018
## Lab 0 - You need to Git

**Purpose:** This purpose of this lab is to gain some passing familiarity with
our coursework submission system. You have a few options for how to complete
and submit your work. There are two suggested options and both will be
demonstrated in class.

## Option 1: Windows Client and a Local Text Editor

This is the easiest to set up, but the least portable and least flexible.

1. Install the [GitHub Windows Client](https://desktop.github.com/). On campus,
   it will be pre-installed on computers in the library computer lab.
1. When you open the client, you will be prompted to log into your GitHub
   account and it will work even if you have two-factor authentication enabled.
1. Once logged in, you will be able to clone a repository from your GitHub
   account with ease.
1. Staging commits and pushing them back to GitHub (thereby "turning in" your
   assignment) is as simple as committing all changes and syncing the
   repository.

We will go over this in class if you wish.

## Option 2: CodeAnywhere and the command line.

Create a [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) account either with your
email or one directly linked to your GitHub account (recommended).

CodeAnywhere's free account only allows you to have one active connection which
means you can technically only have one workspace set up. There are two ways
you can work around this.

1. You can simply delete the container and create a new container for each assignment.
1. You can create one empty container and then use git commands to clone
   repositories and push commits (more flexible and better, but a little harder
   to learn).
  a. [Creating an ssh
  key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
  b. [Adding an ssh key to
  GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

Both of these methods will be covered in the first week of class and you will
be able to choose whichever method you feel most comfortable with.

## The Assignment

*Instructions:** Create a basic HTML file called `index.html` in this
repository. It should be an informative page about an animal of your choice
(real or fictional). If you already know a few HTMl tags, feel free to use
them, but don't sweat it if you don't. This is more about learning git than
HTML.

Once you are finished, commit your changes to the repository and push them back
to GitHub using the method that you like.

If you have _any_ trouble at all with these commands, ask the instructor for
clarifications or another walkthrough. It is essential that you find a workflow
that you are comfortable with because this is how almost all assignments will
be submitted this term.

Good luck!
