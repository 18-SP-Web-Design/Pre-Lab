## Pre-Lab - You need to Git

**Purpose:** This purpose of this lab is to gain some passing familiarity with our coursework submission system. We will be using [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) as our primary workspace since it's convenient, cross-platform, and free, and we will be using GitHub as our version-control/submission platform in conjunction with GitHub Classroom. Follow the instructions in the class closely, because this is how all of your labs will be completed and submitted.

**Assumptions:** This assignment assumes that you have already set up a Codeanywhere account and a GitHub account and linked them together.

**Part 1 - Cloning the Repository:** Clone this repository into a new workspace in your [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) account. Once you are in your workspace, continue on to the next part.

**Part 2 - Instructions:** Create a basic HTML file called `index.html`. It should be an informative page about an animal of your choice (real or fictional). If you already know a few HTMl tags, feel free to use them, but don't sweat it if you don't. This is more about learning git than HTML.

Once you are finished, if you are in your CodeAnywhere workspace, you can push your changes to the repository by entering the following commands into the SSH terminal (these three commands should be committed to memory):

`````
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "Some commit message."
    $ git push -u origin master
`````

If you have trouble with these commands, ask the instructor or refer to the provided course resources.
